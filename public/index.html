<!-- Construct an index.html. At minimum, it should have an <html> tag, a <head>, a <body> and and a single <script> tag to serve up your bundled javascript. It should also have at least one <div> with an id that you can use ReactDOM.render to render your React app into. Also make sure that you only load your bundled javascript AFTER the DOM loads! -->
